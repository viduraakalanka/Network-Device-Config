Outputting log information to a Linux log host

Configuration procedure:

1. Before the configuration, make sure that the device and the PC can reach each other.

2. Configure the device:
# Enable the information center.
<Sysname> system-view
[Sysname] info-center enable

3. Specify the host 1.2.0.1/16 as the log host. Use the channel loghost to output log information
(optional, loghost by default), and use local5 as the logging facility.
[Sysname] info-center loghost 1.2.0.1 channel loghost facility local5

4. Disable the output of log, trap, and debugging information of all modules on channel loghost.
[Sysname] info-center source default channel loghost debug state off log state off
trap state off
To avoid outputting unnecessary information, disable the output of log, trap, and debugging
information on the specified channel (loghost in this example) before you configure an output rule.

5. Configure an output rule to output to the log host the log information that has a severity level of
at least informational.
[Sysname] info-center source default channel loghost log level informational state
on

Note: The logging facility name and the information level specified in the /etc/syslog.conf file must be
identical to those configured on the device using the info-center loghost and info-center source
commands. Otherwise the log information may not be output properly to the log host.
